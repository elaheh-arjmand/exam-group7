## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [the documentation online](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
max(cars$speed)

```


#summary prints the summary of the dataset
#can code and change themes


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

#when have ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} --> tells r what chunk is named--- after comma tells how code is printed echo = FALSE means will run code without showing code as title 

# eval = FALSE will show but not run code

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Original data
THe data is collected from patients and looks at intubation success and failure. [Here are the details](data/codebook.html).

##Reading data
```{r}
read.delim(here("data", "exam_joindata.txt"))

```

#Something else

```

#Tidy Data

-To tidy our data we had to xyz
-Copy code for tidying the data into the chunk 
-could hide it if it is too much information

```{r}

```

#Wrangling

#plots

#Statistical analysis

#R packages etc
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
